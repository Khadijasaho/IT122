In the near future I’ll be working toward being part of a tech company where I can seek out growth opportunities that also align with my values.</p>
       
       <p>I enjoy watching documentaries in my spare time and going on long walks in the morning to clear my mind . I also played volleyball, basketball as a shooter and joined Track & Field as a sprinter and javelin player during high school.
    </p>
